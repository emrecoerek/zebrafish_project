Emre Cörek graduated from Julius-Maximilians-University of Wuerzburg in Germany with a Bachelor's degree in Biology in March 2013. He carried out his Bachelor's thesis for six months at the University Hospital of Wuerzburg about the breast cancer radiosensitizing agent NVP-BEZ235 (Dactolisib). The title of his Bachelor`s thesis was “Modulation der Strahlenempfindlichkeit humaner Mammakarzinom-Zelllinien mittels des neuartigen dualen PI3K- und mTOR-Inhibitors NVP-BEZ235. Einfluss von Hypoxie”.

In July 2015 he graduated from the University of Basel in Switzerland with a Master`s degree in Toxicology. His Master's thesis he accomplished for 10 months at Novartis AG in Basel in Preclinical safety about the renal biomarker Kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1). The title of his thesis was “Spatial and temporal patterns of KIM-1 induction in toxic kidney injury in rats”.

In June 2016, Emre Cörek joined the research group of Prof. Dr. J. Huwyler (Pharmaceutical Technology) as a PhD-candidate. His research is focused on nanoparticles for drug delivery and imaging. He is also involved in the EU Horizon 2020 project NanoREG II for development and implementation of nanoparticle grouping and Safe-by-design approaches within regulatory frameworks together with the Swiss Centre for Applied Human Toxicology (SCAHT).
