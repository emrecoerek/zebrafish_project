I graduated from the Julius Maximilian University of Würzburg in Germany with a Bachelor's degree in "Biology" in 2013. My Bachelor's thesis, I carried out for six months at the University Hospital of Würzburg about the breast cancer radiosensitizing agent "NVP-BEZ235 (Dactolisib)". The title of my Bachelor`s thesis was “Modulation der Strahlenempfindlichkeit humaner Mammakarzinom-Zelllinien mittels des neuartigen dualen PI3K- und mTOR-Inhibitors NVP-BEZ235. Einfluss von Hypoxie”.

In 2015, I graduated with a Master's degree from the University of Basel in Switzerland in "Toxicology". My Master's thesis I accomplished for 10 months at Novartis AG (NIBR) in Basel in Preclinical safety about the renal biomarker Kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1). The title of my thesis was “Spatial and temporal patterns of KIM-1 induction in toxic kidney injury in rats”.

I joined the research group of Prof. Dr. Jörg Huwyler in Pharmaceutical Technology at the University of Basel as a Ph.D. candidate in 2016. My research was focused on nanoparticles for drug delivery and imaging/theranostics. At the same time I was also involved in the EU Horizon 2020 project called "NanoREG II" for development and implementation of nanoparticle grouping and safe-by-design approaches within regulatory frameworks together with the Swiss Centre for Applied Human Toxicology (SCAHT). 
In May 2020, I finished my Ph.D. and since September 2020 I am working as a postdoc regulatory toxicologist at the Swiss Centre for Applied Human Toxicology [(SCAHT)](https://www.scaht.org/de/%C3%BCber-uns/team/dr-emre-%C3%A7%C3%B6rek/) on projects about "succinate dehydrogenase inhibitors (SDHIs)" and others in close contact with multiple authorities such as [(FSVO)](https://www.blv.admin.ch/blv/en/home.html) or [(FOEN)](https://www.bafu.admin.ch/bafu/en/home.html).
