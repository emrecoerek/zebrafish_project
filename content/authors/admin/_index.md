I graduated from the Julius-Maximilians-University of Wuerzburg in Germany with a Bachelor's degree in "Biology" in March 2013. My Bachelor's thesis, I carried out for six months at the University Hospital of Wuerzburg about the breast cancer radiosensitizing agent "NVP-BEZ235 (Dactolisib)". The title of my Bachelor`s thesis was “Modulation der Strahlenempfindlichkeit humaner Mammakarzinom-Zelllinien mittels des neuartigen dualen PI3K- und mTOR-Inhibitors NVP-BEZ235. Einfluss von Hypoxie”.

In July 2015, I graduated with a Master's degree from the University of Basel in Switzerland in "Toxicology". My Master's thesis I accomplished for 10 months at Novartis AG in Basel in Preclinical safety about the renal biomarker Kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1). The title of my thesis was “Spatial and temporal patterns of KIM-1 induction in toxic kidney injury in rats”.

In June 2016, after a one year break with travelling, I joined the research group of Prof. Dr. Jörg Huwyler in Pharmaceutical Technology at the University of Basel as a Ph.D. candidate. My research was focused on nanoparticles for drug delivery and imaging/theranostics. At the same time I was also involved in the EU Horizon 2020 project called "NanoREG II" for development and implementation of nanoparticle grouping and Safe-by-design approaches within regulatory frameworks together with the Swiss Centre for Applied Human Toxicology (SCAHT). 
In May 2020, I finished my Ph.D. (Dr. phil. des.) and in September 2020 I will start working as a regulatory toxicologist at the SCAHT on a very interesting project about "succinate dehydrogenase inhibitors".
